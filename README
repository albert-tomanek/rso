INSTALLING
==========

GNU Linux
---------
  A precompiled Linux binary is in 'bin/rso',
  which was compiled on Lubuntu 16.04 i386.
  
  To compile RSO yourself, run the following commands as root:
  make
  make install
  
  You can then run rso by typing 'rso' in the terminal.

MS Windows
----------
  A precompiled win32 binary exists in 'bin/rso.exe',
  which makes use of 'libsndfile-1.dll'.
  
  This can be installed by running 'install.bat',
  and thereafter be run by opening the command prompt,
  and typing 'rso'.

LIBSNDFILE
==========
This project makes use of libsndfile to read and write WAV files,
which is written by Erik de Castro Lopo, licensed under the LGPL,
and can be downloaded here: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
