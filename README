RSO is a small utility written in C by Albert Tomanek.
It is used to convert sound files between the WAV format,
and the RSO format, used by the Lego Mindstorms NXT computer brick.


Structure of the RSO format:
-------+----------------
Byte   |   Description

0      | Magic byte (always 01)
1      | Compression flag (00 or 01), not implemented yet.
2 & 3  | Number of samples (16-bit unsigned int)
4 & 5  | Samplerate (16-bit unsigned int)
6 & 7  | Padding (and loop flag, not implemented yet)
